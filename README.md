Covers basic computer science ideas in brief

## SOLID

The goal of SOLID is the creation of mid-level software structures that tolerate change, are easy to understand, and are easily used for multiple purposes.

* ***S**ingle Responsibility Principle:* Each piece of software in any corporation is overseen by one individual, so that each module has one, and only one, reason to change. (The best way to make this possible is for the software to reflect the org's social structure). Corollary to [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law).
* ***O**pen-Closed Principle:* Add new code instead of changing existing code. This is "extensibility".
* ***L**iskov substitution principle:* Software modules must adhere to a common contract in order to have interchangeable parts.
* ***I**nterface Segregtion Principle:* Software modules shouldn't depend on things they don't use.
* ***D**ependency Inversion Principle:* High-level policy code should dictate low-level details, not vice versa (like in the old days).
