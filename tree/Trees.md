# Trees
## Binary Search Tree
A binary tree (each node has only two branches) in which the left subtree is always lesser and the right subtree is always greater than the value of the current node. (Duplicates vary according to the implementation).

**Search time:** O(log(n))

**Insertion time:** O(log(n))

**Deletion time:** O(log(n))
